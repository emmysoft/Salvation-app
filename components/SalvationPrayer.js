                LORD JESUS, I come before you today to confess my sins and ask you for forgiveness of my sins. I believe that you died on the Cross of Calvary, was buried in the tomb, and resurrected on the third day all for me. Thank you for doing that, Here I am to accept you and to surrender my life to you. Give me Grace to fulfill your will and fill me with your HOLY SPIRIT, that I may live according to your will on Earth as it is in Heaven. Thank you Heavenly Father for answered prayers in JESUS NAME I PRAY, AMEN
